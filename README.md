# EAI Security Check

A Node.js + TypeScript tool for auditing macOS security settings against ### Initialize Configuration

Create a sample security configuration file:

```bash```bash
# Using standalone executable - Basic usage
./eai-security-check check

# Using globally installed version
eai-security-check check

# Using predefined security profiles (works from any directory)
./eai-security-check check default             # Recommended security settings
./eai-security-check check strict              # Maximum security (3-min auto-lock)
./eai-security-check check relaxed             # Balanced security (15-min auto-lock)
./eai-security-check check developer           # Developer-friendly (remote access enabled)
./eai-security-check check eai                 # EAI focused security (essential checks only)

# Using custom config file
./eai-security-check check --config ./my-config.json

# Save report to file
./eai-security-check check strict --output ./security-report.txt

# Quiet mode (summary only)
./eai-security-check check eai --quiet
```executable
./eai-security-check init

# Using globally installed version
eai-security-check init

# Create with different security profiles
./eai-security-check init --profile strict      # Maximum security (3-min auto-lock)
./eai-security-check init --profile relaxed     # Balanced security (15-min auto-lock)
./eai-security-check init --profile developer   # Developer-friendly (remote access enabled)
./eai-security-check init --profile eai         # EAI focused security (essential checks only)

# Custom filename
./eai-security-check init --file my-config.json
```ion file.

npm run build
```

## Usage

### Get Help

The tool provides comprehensive help information:

```bash
# Using standalone executable
./eai-security-check --help
./eai-security-check help

# Using globally installed version
eai-security-check --help
eai-security-check help

# Command-specific help

```

### Initialize Configuration

Create a sample security configuration file:

```bash
# Create default configuration
eai-security-check init

# Create with different security profiles
eai-security-check init --profile strict      # Maximum security (3-min auto-lock)
eai-security-check init --profile relaxed     # Balanced security (15-min auto-lock)
eai-security-check init --profile developer   # Developer-friendly (remote access enabled)
eai-security-check init --profile eai         # EAI focused security (essential checks only)

# Custom filename
eai-security-check init --file my-config.json
```

This creates a `security-config.json` file with default security requirements:

```json
{
  "filevault": {
    "enabled": true
  },
  "passwordProtection": {
    "enabled": true,
    "requirePasswordImmediately": true
  },
  "autoLock": {
    "maxTimeoutMinutes": 7
  },
  "firewall": {
    "enabled": true,
    "stealthMode": true
  },
  "gatekeeper": {
    "enabled": true
  },
  "systemIntegrityProtection": {
    "enabled": true
  },
  "remoteLogin": {
    "enabled": false
  },
  "remoteManagement": {
    "enabled": false
  },
  "automaticUpdates": {
    "enabled": true,
    "securityUpdatesOnly": true
  },
  "sharingServices": {
    "fileSharing": false,
    "screenSharing": false,
    "remoteLogin": false
  }
}
```

### Run Security Audit

Check your system against the configuration:

```bash
# Using default config file or profile
eai-security-check check

# Using predefined security profiles (works from any directory)
eai-security-check check default             # Recommended security settings
eai-security-check check strict              # Maximum security (3-min auto-lock)
eai-security-check check relaxed             # Balanced security (15-min auto-lock)
eai-security-check check developer           # Developer-friendly (remote access enabled)
eai-security-check check eai                 # EAI focused security (essential checks only)

# Using custom config file
eai-security-check check --config ./my-config.json

# Save report to file
eai-security-check check strict --output ./security-report.txt

# Quiet mode (summary only)
eai-security-check check eai --quiet
```

### Development Commands

For development and testing:

```bash
# Using npm scripts (for development)
npm run dev -- init
npm run dev -- check
npm run dev -- help

# Build and run production version
npm run check
```

## Configuration Options

**Note**: All configuration sections are optional. If a section is omitted from your configuration file, that security check will be skipped entirely.

### 🔒 FileVault
- `enabled`: Boolean - Whether disk encryption should be enabled

### 🔑 Password Protection
- `enabled`: Boolean - Whether login password protection should be enabled
- `requirePasswordImmediately`: Boolean - Whether password should be required immediately after screen saver activates

### ⏰ Auto-lock
- `maxTimeoutMinutes`: Number - Maximum minutes before screen should automatically lock (recommended: 7 or less)

### 🔥 Firewall
- `enabled`: Boolean - Whether application firewall should be enabled
- `stealthMode`: Boolean (optional) - Whether stealth mode should be enabled (makes system less visible to network scans)

### 🛡️ Gatekeeper
- `enabled`: Boolean - Whether Gatekeeper should verify downloaded applications

### 🔐 System Integrity Protection
- `enabled`: Boolean - Whether SIP should be enabled to protect system files

### 🌐 Remote Login
- `enabled`: Boolean - Whether SSH/remote login should be enabled (typically false for security)

### 📱 Remote Management
- `enabled`: Boolean - Whether remote management/screen control should be enabled (typically false)

### 🔄 Automatic Updates
- `enabled`: Boolean - Whether automatic update checking should be enabled
- `securityUpdatesOnly`: Boolean (optional) - Whether security updates should auto-install

### 📡 Sharing Services
- `fileSharing`: Boolean - Whether file sharing should be enabled
- `screenSharing`: Boolean - Whether screen sharing should be enabled
- `remoteLogin`: Boolean - Whether remote login sharing should be enabled

## Security Profiles

The project includes multiple example configurations:

- **`default`**: Recommended security settings (7-minute auto-lock, all security features enabled)
- **`strict`**: Maximum security, minimal convenience (3-minute auto-lock, all security features enabled)
- **`relaxed`**: Balanced security with more convenience (15-minute auto-lock, some relaxed settings)
- **`developer`**: Developer-friendly with necessary remote access enabled
- **`eai`**: EAI focused security (7-minute auto-lock, essential security checks only: FileVault, password protection, auto-lock)

### Using Profiles

Profiles can be used as arguments to the check command:

```bash
# With standalone executable
./eai-security-check check strict      # Use strict security profile
./eai-security-check check eai         # Use EAI focused profile

# With globally installed version
eai-security-check check strict      # Use strict security profile
eai-security-check check eai         # Use EAI focused profile
```

### Customizing Security Checks

The EAI profile demonstrates selective security checking - it only includes essential checks (FileVault, password protection, auto-lock) and skips others (firewall, Gatekeeper, SIP, remote services, etc.). You can create custom configurations by omitting sections you don't want to check.

## Example Output

```
🔒 macOS Security Audit Report
📅 Generated: 7/22/2025, 10:30:00 AM
💻 System: macOS 14.5
✅ Overall Status: FAILED

📋 Security Check Results:
============================================================

✅ PASS FileVault [High Risk]
   Expected: true
   Actual: true
   Status: FileVault is enabled - disk encryption is active
   📝 What it does: FileVault provides full-disk encryption, protecting your data if your Mac is lost or stolen.
   💡 Security advice: Should be ENABLED. Without FileVault, anyone with physical access can read your files by booting from external media.

❌ FAIL Firewall [High Risk]
   Expected: true
   Actual: false
   Status: Firewall is disabled - system is vulnerable to network attacks
   📝 What it does: Application firewall blocks unauthorized network connections and protects against network-based attacks.
   💡 Security advice: Should be ENABLED. Protects against malicious network traffic and unauthorized remote access attempts.

✅ PASS Auto-lock Timeout [Medium Risk]
   Expected: ≤ 7 minutes
   Actual: 5 minutes
   Status: Screen locks after 5 minutes (within acceptable limit)
   📝 What it does: Automatically locks your screen after a period of inactivity to prevent unauthorized access.
   💡 Security advice: Should be ≤7 minutes for security, ≤15 minutes for convenience. Shorter timeouts provide better security.

⚠️  Security Issues Found!
The checks marked as FAIL indicate potential security vulnerabilities.
Review the security advice above and adjust your system settings accordingly.

🚨 HIGH PRIORITY: Firewall, Automatic Updates
